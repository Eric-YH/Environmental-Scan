You are given a CSV with the following columns:

- id
- core_issue

Each row represents a distinct topic extracted from a statement.

Your task is to group these topics into a CLEAR set of MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE categories.

========================
STRICT RULES (MANDATORY)
========================

1. Each id MUST appear in EXACTLY ONE category.
   - No id may appear in more than one category.
   - No id may be omitted or skipped.

2. Categories MUST be mutually exclusive.
   - If two topics are closely related, they MUST be merged.
   - Avoid overlap between categories.

3. Each category MUST cover MULTIPLE topics.
   - Generally at least 2–3 ids.
   - Only single-topic categories are allowed if absolutely unavoidable.

4. Do NOT create overly narrow or event-specific categories.
   - Generalize topics whenever possible.

5. Avoid vague or catch-all categories such as "General Issues", "Miscellaneous", or "Higher Education Trends", except as a last resort for truly unmatched topics.

6. Limit the total number of categories to BETWEEN 6 AND 8.
   - You may create one "Other" category if necessary, but it must include ALL remaining unassigned topics.

7. Categories should represent fundamentally different dimensions, such as:
   - Technology in education
   - Regulation and governance
   - Workforce and careers
   - Student support and well-being
   - Diversity and inclusion
   - Enrollment and access
   - Finance and operations
   - Other (only if topics cannot reasonably fit elsewhere)

8. Minimize the use of "Other". Only assign topics there if they do not fit meaningfully into other categories. ALL leftover topics must be consolidated into a single "Other" category.

========================
OUTPUT FORMAT
========================

- Output a CSV with columns:
  category,description,covers
- Wrap ALL text fields in double quotes.
- Covers must be a comma-separated list of ids.
- Output CSV only. Do NOT include explanations or notes.

========================
FINAL SELF-CHECK
========================

- Every id appears exactly once.
- No category contains only a single id unless unavoidable.
- Total categories are between 6 and 8.
- "Other" includes all leftover unassigned topics, if used.
